# payment-microsv
This is my implentation of a take-home interview assignment I got for some job application for backend python using Flask. 
## Prompt
Build a payment microservice with flask using Docker. Should have the following endpoints.
1. An endpoint to make payment
2. An endpoint to list all transactions
3. An endpoint to get payment balance

You can use any payment gateway

## Note: 
1. I decided to ignore the docker part as I was not having space on my device.
2. I think the prompt was rather vague so I did what I could.
3. This is my first attempt at Flask.
4. I attempted to use Authorize.net as my payment gateway.
